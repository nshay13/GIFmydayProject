COMS W4170: User Interface Design
Final Project: #GIFmyday

GIFMyDay is a digital journal where users can organize entries by time throughout their day with the addition of gifs.

Users can login/register to create an account and add entries for that particular day. User can then view their entries by month or year of their choice.

Users can also go back to delete or edit previously created entries.
